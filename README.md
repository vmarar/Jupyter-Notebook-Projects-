Lending-Club-Analysis

The goal of this project was to assess and analyze data released by the Lending Club in order to identify borrower attributes
that greatley affected interest rate. This project allowed me to apply statistical concepts and gain a better understanding of
the various variables and relationships involved in correlational studies. 
I used a simple linear regression model to further understand the data and attempt to predict interest rate based on the selected borrower features.
